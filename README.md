If you'd like to add a sound, follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds/blob/master/HOW%20TO%20ADD%20SOUNDS.txt). (Make sure it follows the [GitHub AUP](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#2-content-restrictions)

If you're still having trouble adding a sound, ask someone that knows how to add sounds and plays on the server to do it for you.

Please avoid adding loud sounds.
